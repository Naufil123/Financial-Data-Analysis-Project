# Financial-Data-Analysis-ProjectThis Python project utilizes statistical and visual analysis techniques to examine the monthly returns of an assigned stock against the S&P 500 (SPY) index. The analysis includes logarithmic transformations, summary statistics, skewness, kurtosis, and a scatter plot visualization. Furthermore, a linear regression model is fitted to quantify and interpret the relationship between the assigned stock and the broader market index. The project provides insights into the stock's performance and its sensitivity to market movements.
